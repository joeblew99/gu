## Why Gu and What next for Gu.
Gu main purpose is to provide a very simple and elegant approach in rendering front 
end components and projects with Go. It's simplicity will be heavily guarded and
maintained. 

If more complex ideas arise, then those will be built ontop of Gu has seperate 
libraries to offer that niche. But Gu will remain as so, to allow 
anyone to graft and build on top as they see fit.

Only changes that will ever come to the library will be updates for performance, 
fixes or needed changes that simplify and provide better usage for the developer.
